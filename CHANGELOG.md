## Add on Open and Close event props to AvatarMenu Component



**Backwards Compatibility Implications** 

_None_

**New Features** 

### #AvatarMenu new Props

# UI React v5.0.0 (2019-11-12 15:53:54)

## Textarea - Validation message under the field

**Backwards Compatibility Implications**
_None_

**New Features** 
Allow the use of a validation message that will be shown under the textarea field (instead of a tooltip for error)

**Bug Fixes** 
_None_

**Miscellaneous**
Adds an optional validation message under the field as an alternative to `tooltipError`
![TextArea with validation message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/348776/68447182-cbed6180-01bd-11ea-9c98-f7e16cefec4a.png)

1. Choose the type of validation message to `message` (the default is `tooltip`)
2. Provide a value for `validationMessage`
3. When the `isValid` is false the message will be shown under the textarea field


## Add auto position prop to tooltip



**Backwards Compatibility Implications** 

- Changes the meaning of tooltip position names. `left` now means "to the left of the component" rather than "originating from the left edge"

**New Features** 

- Adds 'auto' value for tooltip position enum
- Positions tooltip as far from screen edge as possible

**Backwards Compatibility Implications**

_None_

**New Features**

- Added `minLength` and `maxLength` props to `TextField`

**Note**: Because we allow client code to completely control (e.g.) validation state on TextField, there isn't an easy way of showing when an input value is too short. This is reflected in the updated documentation.

# UI React v3.6.0 (2018-08-22 12:17:26)

## Update webpack and karma dependencies

**Backwards Compatibility Implications**

- Fixed class names of `IconEpic`, `IconInProgress`, `IconNotStarted`, `IconStory` and `IconTask`. This is a breaking change if anyone relied on the wrong class names.
- Updated `webpack` to v4.17.0 - this shouldn't be a breaking change but it's something to be aware of.

## Fix Tabs stealing focus on rerender

**Backwards Compatibility Implications**

The active pane in a set of Tabs will no longer steal focus each time its parent triggers a re-render. In theory, someone could have been relying on this behaviour, but it seems unlikely.

**New Features**

_None_

**Bug Fixes**

Call to `focusPane` on `render` now takes place in `componentDidUpdate` only when moving from unselected to selected. This fixes a bug where a TabsPane would steal focus from a sibling input whenever their parent triggered a re-render.
